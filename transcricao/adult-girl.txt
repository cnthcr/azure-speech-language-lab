My age, but the child will be. She wants to scream and cry and rage and who am I to her grave? The teenage years are never lived. The innocence of high school kids, young romance, and endless nights of carefree joy and pure delight and cry. Now I'm too old to die young. But at least I had some fun spare parts with. Messina raises a noise. Miss Diaries and blacked out nights, kittens, mittens, plushie toys, bows and parts, and sullen boys. Know what's real? I just know I wanna be free. All the things I lost in love swept them underneath the rug. Light the child. Things you broke.
